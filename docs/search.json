    "text": "I am a Latin American sociologist interested in diverse topics such as education, research methods, and discrimination. My primary ‘language’ is social sciences, but I am fluent in those languages spoken by statisticians, data scientists and educationalists, as I had the privilege to work among ‘natives’ from these fields for many years.\nMy work stems from this ‘interethnic friction’ experienced in academia (UnB, UO, UCD, UofT), government (Inep) and international organisations (UNESCO, Unicef). You can find more information on my CV below, or download it here.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
