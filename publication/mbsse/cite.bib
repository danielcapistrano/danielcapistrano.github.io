	abstract = {The Safe Learning Model (SLM) adopts a holistic approach to education, using a socio-ecological model to 
engage  children,  families,  schools,  and  communities  in  addressing  safety,  wellbeing,  and  learning.    Based  on  the  assumption  that  children’s  educational  progress  is  enhanced  when  they  live  in  communities  that   support  gender  equality  and  children’s  well-being,  SLM  seeks  to  address  School-Related  Gender-Based  
Violence (SRGBV) and gender stereotypes, which can be barriers to learning or a cause of school dropout.  
Working  with  MBSSE,  Concern  Worldwide  and  UCD’s  School  of  Education  piloted  the  model  in  2017/18  and  are  currently  implementing  the  third  and  final  year  across  100  primary  schools  in  TK.  The  study  aims  to  generate  evidence  on  the  impact  of  systematically  addressing  SRGBV  through  transformative  gender  
approaches to improve learning outcomes and wellbeing to inform education policy and strategy in Sierra 
Leone and contribute to global learning},
