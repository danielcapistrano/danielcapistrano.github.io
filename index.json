It\u0026rsquo;s main activity is a cross-national survey conducted every two years since 2002, following the highest standards in social survey research.\nESS website The ESS website is the best source for all infomation about the survey. There, you will find the questionnaires, technical documentation for each round and country, publications, an online analysis tool, as well as the data itself.\nESS material Here we describe part of the survey\u0026rsquo;s attributes that you need to know in order to analyse the ESS data. This description is far from complete and if you want a comprehensive and better guide to analyse the ESS data, you shoul take a look at:\n \u0026ldquo;Let papers speak and lips be silent\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n   Roger Jowell, Caroline Roberts, Rory Fitzgerald, Gillian Eva.

Sage Publications, 2007.\n   European Social Survey Education Net\n  Countries  \u0026ldquo;In each country its custom\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n More than 20 countries participate in every round of the European Social Survey.\nThe ESS data is based on representative samples of the national resident population aged 15 or older. Each country is responsible for the translation of the questionnaire, the sample design and the data collection.\nIn practical terms, this means that one must pay attention to some national particularities when analysing the data. Some questions are nationally adapted (political parties, educational levels, religious denominations), some may have a high proportion of missing values, and the data collection periods may differ slightly.\nCountry-specific questions In addition to the core questions administered in all countries, additional questions may have been added to national questionnaires. This country-specific data is not included in the final dataset and you will have to download them from a different area of the ESS website.\nRounds  \u0026ldquo;All times are not alike\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n One of the main objectives of the ESS is to capture social change and stability in Europe. For that, data collection is administered every two years during the final quarter of the year of reference. There have been eight rounds of the ESS to date (2002-2016).\nSome countries, like Ireland, have participated in all rounds since 2002, some only in a few rounds. Here is a list of countries and their respective participation in the ESS.\nModules  \u0026ldquo;Where one door is shut, another opens.\u0026rdquo; - Quixote\n Apart from the ESS core questions which are asked in every round, there are rotating modules with questions focusing on specific themes.\nYou will find a list of all rotating modules and their specific documentation here.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"81c93578f8fb420dfbbde9596fbc06d3","permalink":"/courses/essr/1_ess/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/essr/1_ess/","section":"courses","summary":"\u0026ldquo;He who leans against a good tree finds good shelter\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n The European Social Survey (ESS) is a social research project organised and administered by a network of academic institutions.","tags":null,"title":"What is the ESS?","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" R is a free software that is widely used for data manipulation and analysis.\nThe software has a command line interface which might discourage those who are not familiar with programming. Therefore, we will use it with RStudio, an integrated development environment that will facilitate our work.\nHere are the steps to install both R and RStudio:\n  Download R from the Irish mirror or any other source listed here. Open the downloaded file and follow the instructions for installation.\n  After installing R, download RStudio installer from here https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and follow the instructions for installation.\n  RStudio interface The RStudio interface is divided in four panes:\n  Source is a notepad for you to write, edit and document your code.

Two of them are particularly useful for our basic analysis: tidyverse for data manipulation and visualisation, and essurvey to easily access and import ESS datasets.\nTo install these packages, open RStudio, type the following line at the console prompt and then hit enter:\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;essurvey\u0026quot;))  ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"bc92fb5545d989b7fb4d456da5de0534","permalink":"/courses/essr/2_install/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/essr/2_install/","section":"courses","summary":"R is a free software that is widely used for data manipulation and analysis.\nThe software has a command line interface which might discourage those who are not familiar with programming.","tags":null,"title":"Install R","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" \u0026ldquo;Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for something!\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n The data is free for use and publicly available on the ESS website. You have to register on the ESS website to access the data: [http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/user/new]\nThe registration form has to be filled only once. The email address that you used in your registration will be required to access the ESS data.\nImporting rounds and countries The package \u0026ldquo;essurvey\u0026rdquo; makes it very easy for you to access ESS data directly from R. First, you have to load the package by typing the following line:\nlibrary(essurvey)  Then, you can import data for either a specific round or a specific country. For this tutorial, we will work with two datasets:\n ESS round 8 (2016) with all countries  ess_eight \u0026lt;- import_rounds(rounds = 8, ess_email = \u0026quot;_____@___.com\u0026quot;)  ess_eight \u0026lt;- import_rounds(rounds = 8, ess_email = \u0026quot;danielcapistrano@gmail.com\u0026quot;)  With this command, we told R to do two actions:\na) Import rounds from the ESS repository with the following arguments:\n rounds = specifies which rounds will be imported. For more than one round, you can use c(6,7,8) email = specifies the user importing the data. Type between quotes the email address that you used for registration.  b) Create a data table from the result of the importation with the name of \u0026ldquo;ess_eight\u0026rdquo;. The operator \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;-\u0026quot; (read assign) is used to give a name (on the left side) to the output of the command that you specified on the right side.\nAfter running the command, the console will show a progress bar \u0026ldquo;Dowloading ESS8\u0026rdquo; and, after completion, the environment pane will show an object called \u0026ldquo;ess_eight\u0026rdquo;.\nIreland dataset for all rounds  ess_ireland \u0026lt;- import_all_cntrounds(country = \u0026quot;Ireland\u0026quot;, ess_email = \u0026quot;_____@___.com\u0026quot;)  ess_ireland \u0026lt;- import_all_cntrounds(country = \u0026quot;Ireland\u0026quot;, ess_email = \u0026quot;danielcapistrano@gmail.com\u0026quot;)  With this command, R will import all rounds for \u0026ldquo;Ireland\u0026rdquo; and name this new object as \u0026ldquo;ess_ireland\u0026rdquo;.\nThe essurvey package has several other features to import or download ESS data.

To discover the number of female and male respondents in the eighth round, we can count how many answers we have for each option in the column named \u0026ldquo;gndr\u0026rdquo;:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% count(gndr)  The first line defines from which data table I want to extract the data. In this case, ESS 8 with all countries(ess_eight). The operator %\u0026gt;% (read pipe) is used to connect different commands and can be read as \u0026ldquo;and then\u0026rdquo;.\nThe second line tells R to count the values of the column \u0026ldquo;gndr\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, you can read this command as \u0026ldquo;take dataset ess_eight and then count values for gndr\u0026rdquo;\nYour result should be the following:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% count(gndr)  Grouping If we want to see the result for each country (column named \u0026ldquo;cntry\u0026rdquo;), we can group the ess_eight data table before counting:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% group_by(cntry) %\u0026gt;% count(gndr)  Outputs in tidyverse show only the first rows of the output tables. If you want to view the whole output, you can add the command View () at the end of your code. You can also save the output in the environment using the assign operator \u0026lt;- that we mentioned before.\nFiltering If we want to see the result for one specific country, we can filter the dataset before counting:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% filter (cntry == \u0026quot;IE\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% count(gndr)  In this command, we have to specify a condition with which data will be filtered. In this case the condition is that column cntry must be equal (==) to the value IE, which is the country code for Ireland.\nWeighting Finally, we have to weight our results to get more accurate estimates of the population that we are analysing. The ESS website has a page and a specific guide to explaing how the weights should be used.\nFor most of our single country analysis, we should use the variable pspwght which is a combination of the design weight and the post-stratification weight.\nTo weight the results of our query, we add the argument wt inside the command count and specify the weight variable.\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% filter (cntry == \u0026quot;IE\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% count(gndr, wt = pspwght)  Our results changed only slightly in this case, but for other analyses the differences will be much higher for weighted results.\nMissing values Using the default options of the essurvey package, the dataset will be imported in a Stata format and the missing values will be automatically coded to NA, which is the symbol for missing values in R.\nHowever, if you download the data files from either the ESS website or the R package itself, the missing values (coded as 7, 8 ,9 or 77, 88, 99) might be loaded as ordinary values.\nIf you do not want these values to be considered in the analysis, you have to recode them to NA.

To make this tutorial a bit less dry, I have included a few of Sancho Panza\u0026rsquo;s quotes extracted from an excellent compilation of Dom Quixote\u0026rsquo;s proverbs authored by an Irish scholar: Ulick Ralph Burke.\nThe novel Don Quixote, by Miguel de Cervantes, tells the story of a Spanish nobel who decides to seek, as a knight-errant, for the adventures that fascinated him in his chivalry books. For that, he recruits a faithful squire, Sancho Panza, a peasant to whom Dom Quxote promises the title of governor of an island in retribution for his work.\nDon Quixote is described as a tall and thin man, well versed and idealistic. Sancho Panza is short and fat, illiterate and pragmatic. Sancho counterbalances Quixote\u0026rsquo;s literary knowledge with witty proverbs and quotes.\nApart from entertaining, Quixote\u0026rsquo;s story tells much about learning experiences which are never solitary, and often full of tensions between courage and fear, excitement and frustration. I hope this tutorial will be of a good initial inspiration to your adventures exploring views and attitudes of Europeans.\n \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;there is no proverb which is not true, because they
