It\u0026rsquo;s main activity is a cross-national survey conducted every two years since 2002, following the highest standards in social survey research.\nESS website The ESS website is the best source for all infomation about the survey. There, you will find the questionnaires, technical documentation for each round and country, publications, an online analysis tool, as well as the data itself.\nESS material Here we describe part of the survey\u0026rsquo;s attributes that you need to know in order to analyse the ESS data.

Sage Publications, 2007.\n  European Social Survey Education Net\n  Countries  \u0026ldquo;In each country its custom\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n More than 20 countries participate in every round of the European Social Survey.\nThe ESS data is based on representative samples of the national resident population aged 15 or older. Each country is responsible for the translation of the questionnaire, the sample design and the data collection.\nIn practical terms, this means that one must pay attention to some national particularities when analysing the data. Some questions are nationally adapted (political parties, educational levels, religious denominations), some may have a high proportion of missing values, and the data collection periods may differ slightly.\nCountry-specific questions In addition to the core questions administered in all countries, additional questions may have been added to national questionnaires. This country-specific data is not included in the final dataset and you will have to download them from a different area of the ESS website.\nRounds  \u0026ldquo;All times are not alike\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n One of the main objectives of the ESS is to capture social change and stability in Europe. For that, data collection is administered every two years during the final quarter of the year of reference. There have been eight rounds of the ESS to date (2002-2016).\nSome countries, like Ireland, have participated in all rounds since 2002, some only in a few rounds. Here is a list of countries and their respective participation in the ESS.\nModules  \u0026ldquo;Where one door is shut, another opens.\u0026rdquo; - Quixote\n Apart from the ESS core questions which are asked in every round, there are rotating modules with questions focusing on specific themes.\nYou will find a list of all rotating modules and their specific documentation here.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"81c93578f8fb420dfbbde9596fbc06d3","permalink":"https://www.danielcapistrano.com/courses/essr/1_ess/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/essr/1_ess/","section":"courses","summary":"\u0026ldquo;He who leans against a good tree finds good shelter\u0026rdquo; - Sancho\n The European Social Survey (ESS) is a social research project organised and administered by a network of academic institutions.","tags":null,"title":"What is the ESS?","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"R is a free software that is widely used for data manipulation and analysis.\nThe software has a command line interface which might discourage those who are not familiar with programming.

The email address that you used in your registration will be required to access the ESS data.\nImporting rounds and countries The package \u0026ldquo;essurvey\u0026rdquo; makes it very easy for you to access ESS data directly from R. First, you have to load the package by typing the following line:\nlibrary(essurvey) Then, you can import data for either a specific round or a specific country.

For more than one round, you can use c(6,7,8) email = specifies the user importing the data. Type between quotes the email address that you used for registration.  b) Create a data table from the result of the importation with the name of \u0026ldquo;ess_eight\u0026rdquo;.

To discover the number of female and male respondents in the eighth round, we can count how many answers we have for each option in the column named \u0026ldquo;gndr\u0026rdquo;:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% count(gndr) The first line defines from which data table I want to extract the data. In this case, ESS 8 with all countries(ess_eight). The operator %\u0026gt;% (read pipe) is used to connect different commands and can be read as \u0026ldquo;and then\u0026rdquo;.\nThe second line tells R to count the values of the column \u0026ldquo;gndr\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, you can read this command as \u0026ldquo;take dataset ess_eight and then count values for gndr\u0026rdquo;\nYour result should be the following:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% count(gndr) Grouping If we want to see the result for each country (column named \u0026ldquo;cntry\u0026rdquo;), we can group the ess_eight data table before counting:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% group_by(cntry) %\u0026gt;% count(gndr) Outputs in tidyverse show only the first rows of the output tables. If you want to view the whole output, you can add the command View () at the end of your code. You can also save the output in the environment using the assign operator \u0026lt;- that we mentioned before.\nFiltering If we want to see the result for one specific country, we can filter the dataset before counting:\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% filter (cntry == \u0026quot;IE\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% count(gndr) In this command, we have to specify a condition with which data will be filtered. In this case the condition is that column cntry must be equal (==) to the value IE, which is the country code for Ireland.\nWeighting Finally, we have to weight our results to get more accurate estimates of the population that we are analysing. The ESS website has a page and a specific guide to explaing how the weights should be used.\nFor most of our single country analysis, we should use the variable pspwght which is a combination of the design weight and the post-stratification weight.\nTo weight the results of our query, we add the argument wt inside the command count and specify the weight variable.\ness_eight %\u0026gt;% filter (cntry == \u0026quot;IE\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% count(gndr, wt = pspwght) Our results changed only slightly in this case, but for other analyses the differences will be much higher for weighted results.\nMissing values Using the default options of the essurvey package, the dataset will be imported in a Stata format and the missing values will be automatically coded to NA, which is the symbol for missing values in R.\nHowever, if you download the data files from either the ESS website or the R package itself, the missing values (coded as 7, 8 ,9 or 77, 88, 99) might be loaded as ordinary values.\nIf you do not want these values to be considered in the analysis, you have to recode them to NA.

To make this tutorial a bit less dry, I have included a few of Sancho Panza\u0026rsquo;s quotes extracted from an excellent compilation of Dom Quixote\u0026rsquo;s proverbs authored by an Irish scholar: Ulick Ralph Burke.\nThe novel Don Quixote, by Miguel de Cervantes, tells the story of a Spanish nobel who decides to seek, as a knight-errant, for the adventures that fascinated him in his chivalry books. For that, he recruits a faithful squire, Sancho Panza, a peasant to whom Dom Quxote promises the title of governor of an island in retribution for his work.\nDon Quixote is described as a tall and thin man, well versed and idealistic. Sancho Panza is short and fat, illiterate and pragmatic. Sancho counterbalances Quixote\u0026rsquo;s literary knowledge with witty proverbs and quotes.\nApart from entertaining, Quixote\u0026rsquo;s story tells much about learning experiences which are never solitary, and often full of tensions between courage and fear, excitement and frustration. I hope this tutorial will be of a good initial inspiration to your adventures exploring views and attitudes of Europeans.\n \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;there is no proverb which is not true, because they are all sentences drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences.\u0026rdquo; - Dom Quixote\n ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"e5611b57b3dec4a864caecd5a83d277e","permalink":"https://www.danielcapistrano.com/courses/essr/6_credits/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/essr/6_credits/","section":"courses","summary":"Funding This work is part of the European Social Survey activities in Ireland, which are funded by the Irish Research Council. #LoveIrishResearch\nAcknowledgment The inspiration for this tutorial comes from the excellent documentation for the essurvey R package from Jorge Cimentada","tags":null,"title":"Credits","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Daniel Capistrano","Seaneen Sloan","Jennifer Symonds","Elena Samonova","Ciaran Sugrue","Dympna Devine"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"3a3434f25b4f6035e698dc04b5961bd5","permalink":"https://www.danielcapistrano.com/publication/jacpr/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jacpr/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims to discuss the construction of two composite indices to assess children’s experiences with violence and peace in primary schools in Sierra Leone.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Assessing experiences with violence and peace in primary schools in Sierra Leone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathew Creighton","Daniel Capistrano","Monika da Silva Pedroso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"ecdfac796e01a6243d1f2c4df152eeec","permalink":"https://www.danielcapistrano.com/publication/jimi/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jimi/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we show that upward educational mobility can moderate antipathy towards immigration, but this is more applicable in country-contexts where parental education is less relevant.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Educational Mobility and Attitudes Towards Migration from an International Comparative Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Capistrano","Christyne Carvalho"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"b0e25c22859e797d5f77bb18783b1f1e","permalink":"https://www.danielcapistrano.com/publication/talis/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/talis/","section":"publication","summary":"We compared 8 national reports from the OECD TALIS.

The  study  aims  to  generate  evidence  on  the  impact  of  systematically  addressing  SRGBV  through  transformative  gender approaches to improve learning outcomes and wellbeing to inform education policy and strategy in Sierra Leone and contribute to global learning.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Safe Learning Model Integrating Transformative Gender Approaches to Strengthen Inclusive Pedagogies and Practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dympna Devine","Giuseppe Bolotta","Elena Samonova","Ciaran Sugrue","Seaneen Sloan","Jennifer Symonds","Daniel Capistrano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c9e39368ffa1b34a65712a0785dd1c97","permalink":"https://www.danielcapistrano.com/publication/childhood/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/childhood/","section":"publication","summary":"We explore the tensions that arise between transformation and preservation in the field in light of wider social, cultural and economic change, and the negotiation of the generational contract in contexts of high risk and inter-dependency.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Generationing education and development in rural Sierra Leone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henrique de Castro","Daniel Capistrano","Sonia Ranincheski","Elvis Bisong Tambe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"6342e13b01900080f3f5b93b31cccf99","permalink":"https://www.danielcapistrano.com/publication/rlop/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rlop/","section":"publication","summary":"Using data from the World Values Survey, we confirm that variables related to material conditions are the best predictor for secularization and self-expression among Western European countries.
