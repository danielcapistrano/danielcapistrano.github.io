# About


![](./featured.png){width="50%"}

The World Values Survey is the largest academic social survey project in activity, conducted in about 100 countries since 1981. I have been involved in the administration of the Survey in Brazil since it's 5th Wave in 2006. 

Currently, [Henrique Castro](https://www.ufrgs.br/fce/henrique-carlos-de-oliveira-de-castro/), [Sofia Vizcarra](https://www.ufrgs.br/ifch/index.php/es/sofia-isabel-vizcarra-castillo-1) and I are planning the fieldwork of the 8th wave.
