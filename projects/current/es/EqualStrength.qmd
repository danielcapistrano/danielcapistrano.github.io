# About 

![](./banner.png){width="50%"}

EqualStrength is a Horizon Europe project funded by the European Union. This research project investigates cumulative and structural forms of discrimination, outgroup prejudice and hate crimes against ethnic, racial and religious minorities. 

Since 2023, I am a member of the EqualStrength team working directly with [Mathew Creighton](https://www.mathewcreighton.eu), who is the Principal Investigator of the project. 

For more information, please visit the project's website:
