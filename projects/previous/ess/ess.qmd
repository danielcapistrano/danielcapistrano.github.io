The European Social Survey investigates social attitudes across several European countries since 2002. I participated in the administration of the 9th round in Ireland together with [Philip O'Connell](https://people.ucd.ie/philip.oconnell),  [Mathew Creighton](https://www.mathewcreighton.eu), and [Micheal Collins](https://people.ucd.ie/micheal.collins).
