In partnership with the UCD School of Education, Concern Worldwide conducted a five-year research study to provide evidence on strategies to improve learning and reduce School Related Gender Based Violence (SRGBV) in Sierra Leone.

The Safe Learning Study involved a randomised control trial of tiered interventions known as the ‘The Safe Learning Model’ in 100 communities.

I worked in the administration of the fieldwork and data analysis together with Dympna Devine, Seaneen Sloan, Ciaran Sugrue, Jennifer Symonds, Elena Samonova, Aimee Smith, and Ryan Gibbons.
