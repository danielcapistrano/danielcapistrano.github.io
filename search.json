    "text": "Abstract\nThis study examined the effects of advance letters on individual participation in the 2018 round of the European Social Survey in Ireland. As participation rates in household surveys have been in decline in many countries, understanding the impact of engagement strategies, such as prior contact, are crucial for fieldwork planning and overall quality of data collection. Based on a natural experiment, we assessed the likelihood of individuals to take part in the survey comparing those who have received an advance letter with those who did not receive it. Contrary to previous evidence on the effectiveness of prior contact, our results indicate that individuals in the sample that received an advance letter are less likely to take part in the survey. We discuss these results in light of an increasing public scepticism regarding social surveys and data privacy.\nauthors:\ndate: “2022-01-01T00:00:00Z” doi: “10.13094/SMIF-2022-00002” featured: false image: caption: ’’ focal_point: “” preview_only: false projects: [] publication: ‘Survey Methods - Insights from the Field’ publication_short: “” publication_types: - “2” publishDate: “2022-01-01T00:00:00Z” slides: “” summary: tags: - Source Themes title: The effect of advance letters on survey participation.

    "text": "Abstract\nA growing number of countries in Latin America are administering education censuses to collect individualized information on every student, teacher, and school within their education systems. Despite the cost and complexity of conducting a universal data collection, instead of a sample survey, these sources are crucial for a more inclusive education planning. This universal aspect is particularly relevant in Latin American societies that are not only ethnically diverse but also highly unequal and excluding societies. In this sense, data produced by education censuses are becoming increasingly relevant for other policy areas in the region. To analyse countries’ trajectories in relation to census taking and the use of ethnoracial categories in education censuses, we have analyzed and compared national regulations as well as data collection documentation and instruments from ten Latin American countries. Taking the past three decades as a reference, we observed that the political context of increasing tensions between neoliberal education reforms and recognition movements was decisive for the design of education statistical systems in Latin America. Results indicate that the existence of regular data collection on indigenous peoples via education censuses is related to a broader national political commitment from governments to recognize these populations and their cultural needs. However, further analysis of national education plans suggests that despite this rather generalized recognition, the political use of these data differs significantly among countries. We identify one group that proposes the use of ethnicity data to reinforce traditional practices in educational planning and another group that proposes a post-colonial revision of these practices. authors:\ndate: “2022-01-01T00:00:00Z” doi: “10.13094/SMIF-2022-00002” featured: false image: caption: ’’ focal_point: “” preview_only: false projects: [] publication: ‘Survey Methods - Insights from the Field’ publication_short: “” publication_types: - “2” publishDate: “2022-01-01T00:00:00Z” slides: “” summary: tags: - Source Themes title: The effect of advance letters on survey participation.

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study examined the effects of advance letters on individual participation in the 2018 round of the European Social Survey in Ireland. As participation rates in household surveys have been in decline in many countries, understanding the impact of engagement strategies, such as prior contact, are crucial for fieldwork planning and overall quality of data collection. Based on a natural experiment, we assessed the likelihood of individuals to take part in the survey comparing those who have received an advance letter with those who did not receive it. Contrary to previous evidence on the effectiveness of prior contact, our results indicate that individuals in the sample that received an advance letter are less likely to take part in the survey. We discuss these results in light of an increasing public scepticism regarding social surveys and data privacy.\nauthors:\ndate: “2022-01-01T00:00:00Z” doi: “10.13094/SMIF-2022-00002” featured: false image: caption: ’’ focal_point: “” preview_only: false projects: [] publication: ‘Survey Methods - Insights from the Field’ publication_short: “” publication_types: - “2” publishDate: “2022-01-01T00:00:00Z” slides: “” summary: tags: - Source Themes title: The effect of advance letters on survey participation.
